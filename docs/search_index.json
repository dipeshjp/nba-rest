This equates to each team having to play about every other day on average. For such a fast paced and strenuous sport where there is constant motion and explosive movements, there seems to be a lot of basketball played in a relatively short time frame. Not surprisingly, the ramifications of such a dense schedule have been part of the discourse of national media outlets for some time. It could even be said that the conversations may have been sparked from the behavior of NBA teams themselves, who frequently sit important players for neither non-injury nor personal related reasons. This behavior implies teams are concerned that players are sometimes not getting enough rest between games. While rest is important for injury prevention, it is also important for performance. I am interested in exploring the impact of rest on the latter. Of course, winning is the ultimate goal in any competitive sport. So how does prior rest impact a team’s likelihood of winning? I would also like to examine the effect of time on the impact of rest. Is rest more impactful later in the season than in the beginning where team’s are fully recovered after the offseason. Digging deeper, what specific aspects of the game are affected by differences in rest levels? We can look at the parts of the sport where energy plays an important part of success like 3 point shooting, offensive rebounding, and turnover forcing. Also, we can look at how the shot distance distribution changes with rest. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle. This data was originally scraped from the highly reputable website basketball-reference.com which stores play by play data for each NBA game, provided by SportRadar, the official statistics provider of the NBA. Each game on basketball-reference.com has its own url. The data was scraped using a Python script that takes in each game url and parses the information contained on the page to reproduce the same data and then stores the information for each game into one complete dataset by season. From a small sampling, the data from Kaggle matches exactly the data contained on basketball-reference.com, although in a different format more conducive for analysis. Of course, I could have scraped the data from basketball-reference.com or even NBA.com myself. However, this would require writing a lengthy script which is unlikely to be any better than the Python one already written given my elementary skills in web scraping. As for the dataset itself, it contains 613671 plays across 40 variables. In other words, this is a 613671 by 40 dataset. Another way to think of a play is as an event. Any time some meaningful event happens in a game it is recorded. The events that are recorded in the dataset are: shot attempt, block, foul, rebound, violation, timeout, free throw attempt, substitution, turnover, and jumpball. In other words, any time one of these events happen there is a row observation in the dataset. Other information is also recorded, but these are the events that trigger an observation. Most of the variables contained in the raw dataset will be of no use to us. The ones that will be are: Date, AwayTeam, AwayScore, HomeTeam, HomeScore, Shooter, ShotType, ShotOutcome, ShotDist, Rebounder, ReboundType, and TurnoverPlayer. Here is some information on them: Date - time in month-day-year format AwayTeam - traveling team Shooter - player attempting shot along with team affiliation ShotType - value of a made shot attempt plus type of shot ShotOutcome - make or miss ShotDist - distance from the basket of shot attempt Rebounder - player who grabbed rebound and team affiliation ReboundType - did rebound occur while player was on offense or defense TurnoverPlayer - player who gave away possession to other team and team affiliation I decided to use data from the last full NBA season before the Covid-19 pandemic, which was in 2018-2019. My thought process was that this season is recent enough to be meaningful and also more representative of a typical NBA season than any of the seasons affected by the pandemic. The 2019-2020 season was dramatically affected. And the current season is still ongoing so the data would be incomplete for our purposes. After exploring the dataset, there were no issues discovered. The data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/schmadam97/nba-playbyplay-data-20182019 "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We want regular season play by play information for each team. However, the original dataset has a team variable across multiple columns. We can change that using pivot longer. Also, the team affiliation in the event variables is the only thing we care about for those columns. We remove the excess player information from those columns. Then after doing these two things, we need to map the columns of the dataset to our variables of interest. We create functions to achieve that. This play level data will be useful for us when we analyze how shot distance distribution is affected by rest levels. Most of our analysis though will use game level data so we summarize the transformed play level data to a game level. We also use the game level data to calculate the amount of rest days between games for each team. We necessarily append this variable to the play level data. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values As has already been mentioned, in the original dataset rows represent events that happen. Since events are mutually exclusive the non-occurring events in a row are represented by NA. In our case, NA is information rather than a lack thereof. However, this creates the problem of finding actual missing values represented by NA. One way to combat this is to find NA values where they are not expected to be. Overall, looking at the visna plot we do not see any NA’s where there should not be. We will focus on the variables that will be of use to us. When there is a missing value with AwayPlay there is a filled value for HomePlay and vice versa. There does not appear to be a case where neither variable is filled which would be an indication of a true missing value since one of the teams must make a play. In terms of event variables, we see that shooting variables are the most common and contain the least NA’s which makes sense since shots are the most common events so those cells should be filled most frequently. Additionally, we see that rebound variables are second most common and turnovers third which is consistent with conventional wisdom. The other variables of interest like Date show no missing values. The row missing patterns are difficult to interpret since there are so many different patterns caused by the prevalence of informational NA’s. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results Before we assess the effect of rest on the various measures of performance we take a preliminary look at the frequencies of different rest intervals. It is easy to see that 1 day of rest between games is far and away the most common. 1 day of rest occurs 3 to 4 times more frequently than the next most frequent rest period which is 0 and 2 days. We see that there is a substantially smaller sample of games after this. To make analysis easier and less cluttered, we decided to bin values exceeding 2 rest days into 1 category called 3+. Our focus will mostly be on 0, 1, and 2 rest days since the sample sizes are large. We note that 10 days of rest are associated with season opening games where there were no games prior. Since we are looking at the data on a game level and not team by team it is important to make sure that there is not a clustering of certain teams that have played an abnormal number of games for a given rest level. Since teams are of different quality, this would have the potential to confound our analysis. We see that teams play roughly 12 games a season with 0 days of rest between games, 50 games with 1 day, 16 with 2 days, and 4 with 3 or more days. There really isn’t much variation about those averages and no outliers or clustering of note. Therefore, team quality should not confound our analysis. Also since playing back to back games is the most burdensome, we have organized the data in that way. The spread for back to backs is the smallest which is not surprising since the NBA is most conscious of this so it tries to give each team the same number of back to backs as possible. We see a clear pattern that teams win more often as the number of rest days between games increases. The effect seems to be largest when going from 0 days of rest to 1 and then trails off as if to suggest there are diminishing returns to rest. Teams with no days of rest win materially less than half of their games. Wins and losses does not tell us anything about how much a team wins or loses by. It could be said that score differential is more insightful than win/loss because the degree to which a team wins or losses has more predictive power. As an example, it would be questionable to say a team that wins by 20 compared to another team that wins by 1 against a common opponent are of the same quality. We see that the pattern is the same when looking at final score differential. The effect of rest is greatest when going from 0 to 1 day of rest. We see clearly that teams with 0 days of rest have a negative point differential on average whereas for the other levels the point differential is positive. It seems as if going from 0 to 1 day of rest confers about a positive 5 point advantage. It could be hypothesized that the effects of rest are amplified as the season progresses and wear and tear on players accumulates. If this were the case then we should see a fanning out of the smoothing lines as the season progresses. However it does not appear to be the case here. It is interesting to note that during the first couple months of the season point differential correlates how one might expect. The more rest the greater the point differential. In other parts of the season, there appears to be no discernible pattern. It is not uncommon to hear that shooting starts from the legs. As legs go, so does shooting, particularly long distance shooting since that would presumably require the most energy. We can check the effect of rest on long distance shooting by looking at the percentage of 3 point attempts made by rest days. We see that rest has a small but meaningful effect on shooting efficiency. The average percentage of 3 point attempts made increases with more rest days. If teams lack of rest causes fatigue to roll over from one game to the next we might expect that teams would choose to take easier shots that the defense is willing to concede rather than working for high value shots that the defense does not want the opponent to get. High value shots are those closest to the basket and 3 point attempts. These shots have the highest expected value. Medium range shots have the lowest payoff but are the easiest to get. Unsurprisingly we see bimodality located at the extremes of shot distance. 0 represents at the basket shot attempts and 3 pointers are roughly 23 feet from the basket. For the most part the shapes of the histograms are remarkably similar. We see that the 3 point attempt part of the distribution remains similar throughout. So it appears that teams shoot the same number of threes regardless of rest days but efficiency drops with less rest. The one difference appears to be at basket attempts, which are the most energy taxing. Basket attempts appear to increase with more rest. As an aside, we can read more into the 3+ rest day category here since this data is taken from play by play data which has a much larger sample size. Overlaying the density curves of the shot distribution histogram does not appear to support our claim that at basket attempts increase with more rest. In fact, the density curves show that 3+ days of rest makes it least likely to find shots close to the basket. However, we do not read too much into this because we can clearly see that the density curves overlaid on the density histograms do not capture well the start of the histograms. We rely more on the histogram and proceed with our initial conclusion that basket attempts increase with rest. There are certain skills in basketball that are considered to be overly reliant on effort. Grabbing offensive rebounds is one of them. Here we can clearly see that with more rest the percentage of available offensive rebounds retrieved increases. Forcing the opposing team to lose possession of the basketball is another skill that is considered to require a lot of effort. Again, we can clearly see an effect although only going from 0 rest days to 1. On average, it looks like teams average 1 more turnover forced per game going from 0 to 1 days of rest. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component I was unable to complete this part. I would have created an interactive bar chart that shows the different 3 point percentages by rest days with a drop down menu to select different teams. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion After completing this exploratory analysis, it seems clear that rest has an impact on performance, although marginally so. However, the small impact is not entirely surprising since there are so many variables that go into performance. Teams win more frequently and by greater margins as days of rest between games increase. They shoot better from the 3 point line, grab more offensive rebounds, and force more turnovers. Often the biggest impact of rest is seen going from 0 days of rest to 1 day of rest. One limiting factor of this analysis is a lack of independence in the data. Each game is recorded as two observations, one for each team. Clearly we know that the performance of one team in a game is not independent of the other team. The pair of observations from each game are associated with one another. With more time, I would like to get more granular with the analysis and look at player level effects of rest. For example, is there a positional effect? Do smaller players who move around more frequently feel the effect of a lack of rest more than bigger players? How about an age effect? Do older players benefit more from rest? Even still, how does rest affect injury likelihood? These are questions that would require another dataset. "]]
