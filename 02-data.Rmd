I decided to use season data from the last full season before the Covid-19 pandemic, which
was in 2018-2019. My thought process was that this season is recent enough to be meaningful and more representative of a typical NBA season than any of the seasons affected by the pandemic. The 2019-2020 season was dramatically effected. And the current season is still ongoing.
